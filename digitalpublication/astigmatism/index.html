          <p>Astigmatism is a common vision condition that causes blurred vision. It occurs when the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is irregularly shaped or sometimes because of the curvature of the lens inside the eye. <br><br>

            Astigmatism is an irregularly shaped cornea or lens that prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, the light-sensitive surface at the back of the eye. The surface of the cornea is shaped more like a football instead of round like a basketball and the eye is unable to focus light rays to a single point. In this case, vision becomes out of focus at any distance. In addition, the curvature of the lens inside the eye can change, resulting in an increase or decrease in astigmatism. This change frequently occurs in adulthood and can precede the development of naturally occurring cataracts. <br><br>

            Astigmatism frequently occurs with other vision conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness). Together these vision conditions are referred to as refractive errors because they affect how the eyes bend or “refract” light.

      <div class="section-content">
          <p>Astigmatism may occur because of the toricity of the cornea that is calculated through keratometry (corneal astigmatism) or it maybe due to the crystalline lens (lenticular astigmatism). The sum of both the corneal and lenticular astigmatism is known as the total astigmatism, which is captured during  retinoscopy. 

          <br><br>  Astigmatism can be corneal or lenticular. Corneal astigmatism occurs when the front surface of your eye (cornea) has a different curvature in one direction. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface at the front of the eye. It plays a vital role in refracting light, allowing us to see clearly. Composed of five layers, the cornea is richly supplied with nerves, making it sensitive to touch and pain. Its curvature and shape help to focus light, with about 2/3 of the eye’s total optical power coming from the cornea. A healthy cornea is essential for maintaining good vision, and certain conditions such as dry eye, infection, or trauma can affect its function and cause vision problems.
          
          <br><br> Lenticular astigmatism is a result of a difference in curvature in the lens.The lens is located in the eye. By changing its shape, the lens changes the focal distance of the eye. In other words, it focuses the light rays that pass through it (and onto the retina) in order to create clear images of objects that are positioned at various distances. It  also  works  together  with the cornea to refract, or bend, light. 

          The lens is of ellipsoid, biconvex shape. An ellipsoid is similar to a sphere but stretched out, like an olive, and biconvex means it’ s rounded outward on both sides. The lens is about 10 mm across and 4 mm from front to back in adults, although its shape and size varies as it changes its focus.
          
          The lens consists of the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. The lens capsule is the smooth, transparent outermost layer of the lens, while the lens fibers are long, thin, transparent cells that form the bulk of the lens. The lens epithelium lies between these two and is responsible for the stable functioning of the lens. It also creates lens fibers for the lifelong growth of the lens.

        <p>Hyperopia is a condition in which an image of a distant object becomes focused behind the retina, making objects up close appear out of focus.
          <br><br>
          Myopia is a condition in which, opposite of hyperopia, an image of a distant object becomes focused in front of the retina, making distant objects appear out of focus. Myopia is the most common refractive error seen in children and can be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>

        <p>Regular astigmatism is the most common type of astigmatism. In this type, the principal meridians, which are the two lines of steepest and flattest curvatures on the cornea, are perpendicular to each other. This means that the cornea is curved more in one direction than in the other (sometimes described as being shaped like a football rather than a soccer ball). Regular astigmatism can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.
          <br><br>
          Irregular astigmatism is less common than regular astigmatism. In this type, the principal meridians aren’ t perpendicular to each other. This means that the cornea is curved irregularly in multiple directions. Eye injuries, scarring and certain eye conditions such as keratoconus can cause irregular astigmatism. This type of astigmatism can be more difficult to correct than regular astigmatism and may require custom-made contact lenses, known as scleral lenses.

          <p>The eye has two structures with curved surfaces that bend (refract) light onto the retina, which makes the images shown in Figure 1:

The cornea, the clear front surface of the eye along with the tear film. The lens, a clear structure inside the eye that changes shape to help the eye focus on near objects. In a perfectly shaped eye, each of these elements has a round curvature, like the surface of a smooth ball. A cornea or lens with such curvature bends (refracts) all incoming light equally to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina at the back of the eye.

<br><br> If either the cornea or the lens is egg-shaped with two mismatched curves, light rays aren’t bent the same, which means that two different images form. These two images overlap or combine and result in blurred vision. Astigmatism is a type of refractive error..</p>

        <p>Family studies have supported a major role for genetics in astigmatism, with children with astigmatic parents being at a significantly higher risk (approximately two times) of the development of astigmatism than those with nonastigmatic parents.<br><br>
          The first twin study of the genetics of astigmatism, conducted in the early 1950s, showed a high concordance of astigmatism between monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. This conclusion was challenged by subsequent twin studies. For instance, Teikari et al. reported a similar concordance for astigmatism in both MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, which implies a stronger role of environmental risk factors. However, there are drawbacks to some methods used to study astigmatism—for instance, postal surveys, sample sizes, and selective age ranges. A larger twin study (506 female twin pairs) based in the United Kingdom reported findings contrary to those in previous reports and showed a correlation for astigmatism almost four times larger in MZ than in DZ twin pairs, thus suggesting a major role of nonadditive genetics in this phenotype. Further support for nonadditive genetic effects on astigmatism came from a study by Grjibovski et al., who surveyed 3334 twin pairs and found a heritability of 63%, with dominant genetic effects explaining the majority (54%) of the variance in astigmatism.</p>

      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Environmental factors can play a role in the progression of astigmatism. For example, prolonged and frequent use of electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets can cause eye strain and fatigue, leading to worsening astigmatism symptoms. Excessive exposure to UV rays from the sun or bright lights can also contribute to the development and progression of astigmatism. br
        <br>Keep in mind that while reading with low or dim lights can make it harder for eyes to focus, it doesn’t harm vision or cause astigmatism. However, if you already have an eye with astigmatism, and you read in low light, you might notice increased blurriness.</p>
