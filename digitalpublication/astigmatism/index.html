          <p>Astigmatism is a common vision condition that causes blurred vision. It occurs when the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is irregularly shaped or sometimes because of the curvature of the lens inside the eye. <br><br>

            Astigmatism is an irregularly shaped cornea or lens that prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, the light-sensitive surface at the back of the eye. The surface of the cornea is shaped more like a football instead of round like a basketball and the eye is unable to focus light rays to a single point. In this case, vision becomes out of focus at any distance. In addition, the curvature of the lens inside the eye can change, resulting in an increase or decrease in astigmatism. This change frequently occurs in adulthood and can precede the development of naturally occurring cataracts. <br><br>

            Astigmatism frequently occurs with other vision conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness). Together these vision conditions are referred to as refractive errors because they affect how the eyes bend or “refract” light.

      <div class="section-content">
          <p>Astigmatism may occur because of the toricity of the cornea that is calculated through keratometry (corneal astigmatism) or it maybe due to the crystalline lens (lenticular astigmatism). The sum of both the corneal and lenticular astigmatism is known as the total astigmatism, which is captured during  retinoscopy. 

          <br><br>  Astigmatism can be corneal or lenticular. Corneal astigmatism occurs when the front surface of your eye (cornea) has a different curvature in one direction. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface at the front of the eye. It plays a vital role in refracting light, allowing us to see clearly. Composed of five layers, the cornea is richly supplied with nerves, making it sensitive to touch and pain. Its curvature and shape help to focus light, with about 2/3 of the eye’s total optical power coming from the cornea. A healthy cornea is essential for maintaining good vision, and certain conditions such as dry eye, infection, or trauma can affect its function and cause vision problems.
          
          <br><br> Lenticular astigmatism is a result of a difference in curvature in the lens.The lens is located in the eye. By changing its shape, the lens changes the focal distance of the eye. In other words, it focuses the light rays that pass through it (and onto the retina) in order to create clear images of objects that are positioned at various distances. It  also  works  together  with the cornea to refract, or bend, light. 

          The lens is of ellipsoid, biconvex shape. An ellipsoid is similar to a sphere but stretched out, like an olive, and biconvex means it’ s rounded outward on both sides. The lens is about 10 mm across and 4 mm from front to back in adults, although its shape and size varies as it changes its focus.
          
          The lens consists of the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. The lens capsule is the smooth, transparent outermost layer of the lens, while the lens fibers are long, thin, transparent cells that form the bulk of the lens. The lens epithelium lies between these two and is responsible for the stable functioning of the lens. It also creates lens fibers for the lifelong growth of the lens.

        <p>Hyperopia is a condition in which an image of a distant object becomes focused behind the retina, making objects up close appear out of focus.
      <br><br>
      Myopia is a condition in which, opposite of hyperopia, an image of a distant object becomes focused in front of the retina, making distant objects appear out of focus. Myopia is the most common refractive error seen in children and can be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>
